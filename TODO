TODO:
- Clean up readme
- Ability to sort attributes alphanumerically
- Ability to certain attributes in a pre-defined list (comma separated)
- Ability to apply indendation rules (if enabled) if N amount attributes are on the element
	e.g.
	<input
		class="first-name"
		type="text"
		placeholder="Please enter your first name"
	/>

	Different methods of auto-indentation would be implemented (of course current work preferences would be done first)

	Different methods might be differientiated by type (e.g. for each method of
	autoindentation, there would be a list of attributes that it would apply to.
	There would be a default method so any attributes not defined would apply the
	default method of auto indent/strucutre)

	Method 1:
	---------
	<div
		id="app"
		class="container"
		data-something-else="2"
	>
		<!-- Code -->
	</div>

	Method 2:
	---------
	<div
		id="app"
		class="container"
		data-something-else="2">
		<!-- Code -->
	</div>

	Method 3: (selected items on base line, everything else on additional lines)
	---------
	<div id="app" class="container"
		data-something="hello"
		data-something-else="2"
	>
		<!-- Code -->
	</div>



If the attribute was self closing (detected '/' before closing '>' of the base tag), then it would format like an input
Method 1: If enough attributes are included
	<input
		class="first-name"
		type="text"
		placeholder="Please enter your first name"
	/>

Method 2: If enough attributes are included
	<input
		class="first-name"
		type="text"
		placeholder="Please enter your first name"/>

Method 3: If not enough attributes are included (user wants splitting to occur when more attributes are present, e.g. 4)
	<input class="first-name" type="text" placeholder="Please enter your first name"/>

Otherwise, the closing element, will be automatically adjusted to have the same indentation level as the opening (if there is only whitespace before the element's starting tag)
	<div
		...
		disabled>
	</div>

This option can be disabled because generally this would already be correct beforehand, and it might cause issues with elements where a self closing tag is not required (e.g. img)
